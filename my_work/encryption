I decided that I wanted to design intelligent systems through ML, NNs and signal processing. In order to lay the foundation of solely using neural networks that can serve a purpose, I decided to integrate NNs with fundamental mathematics. For my bachelorâ€™s minor thesis, realizing that security is an important parameter in any comprehensive system, I took cryptography as an elective. I decided to be the project leader of a team, to design an encryption system that utilized the theory of non-linear dynamical systems in conjunction with neural networks. After the shared key and plaintext are fed into the system, we proposed to extract values from the chaotic region of the logistic map, while having the key set the initial conditions for the logistic equation. We utilized the Lyapunov exponent and neural networks to encrypt the plaintext, through the generation of a chaotic binary sequence. Along with our computed P-values of the 192 bits of input being greater than 0.01, we passed all the NIST tests, proving the sequence to be completely random and tough to break.
